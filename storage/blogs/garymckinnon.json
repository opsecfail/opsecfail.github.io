    "blog" : "Former hairdresser and system admin from Scotland with Asperger Syndrome, Gary McKinnon, was accused in 2002 of perpetrating the 'biggest military computer hack of all time', although he himself states that he was merely looking for evidence of free energy suppression and a cover-up of UFO activity and other technologies potentially useful to the public. On 16 October 2012, after a series of legal proceedings in Britain, then Home Secretary Theresa May blocked his extradition to the United States. US authorities stated he deleted critical files from operating systems, which shut down the United States Army's Military District of Washington network of 2000 computers for 24 hours. He also posted a notice on the military's website: 'Your security is crap'. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, he allegedly deleted weapons logs at the Earle Naval Weapons Station, rendering its network of 300 computers inoperable and paralyzing munitions supply deliveries for the US Navy's Atlantic Fleet. He was also accused of copying data, account files, and passwords onto his own computer. US authorities stated that the cost of tracking and correcting the problems he caused was over $700,000. He was caught after they found him, in part, based on evidence of his IP and his girlfriend's email address in the server logs of Binary Research, the distributor of RemotelyAnywhere, the program he used to access the military computers. Moral of the story: Hide your IP before doing retarded shit.",
