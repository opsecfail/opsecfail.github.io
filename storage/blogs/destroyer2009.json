This action caused chaos in the Apex gaming community, as the organizers of the event had to stop and postpone it.<br><br>Destroyer2009 OpSec failures are pretty obvious. His consistent use of the same and unique username, timoxa5651, across multiple social media platforms facilitated the tracing of his online footprint. His email was found through his GitHub commits, which led to further uncovering of his identity.<br><br>As expected, he mixed his online persona with his personal life. He used the same email to leave reviews on places in Google Maps. In a data breach it is revealed that the person who owns this email lives in the same location as the google maps reviews, thus cementing the idea that he lives in XYZ. Also, talking online might lead to OSF, as in the data breach some info suggested he was around 18 years old, and in a stream, timoxa did say he was 18, which may solidify one's belief in identifying him.<br><br>In short, we see that his major OpSec failure is mixing his online and offline identities.",
