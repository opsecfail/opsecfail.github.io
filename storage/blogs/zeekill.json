So his OSF is when he accidentally uploaded his own home folder along with the Vastaamo patient data, which include his private SSH folder and a list of known hosts, which lead clues to him, so  we categorize this LSI(Leakage of Sensitive Information), so remember to check what you upload, and in that imma add this to the PO(Post Upload) category. Also while  declaring the amount ur paid just use a far away currency if yo ass in USA use yen, and tell them to use google to convert, or just use the crypto you use.",
