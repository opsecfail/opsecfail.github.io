Jeremy Hammond is indeed the creator of the site.<br><br>The hack that made him on the eyes of the fed is when he hacked into the private intelligence firm startfor, which resulted to thousands of military documents to be leaked onto the internet detailing a wide range of different sensitive government secrets.<br><br>The FBI was able to track him down but they weren't able to gather much from his computer because his hard drive very well encrypted, respect to him for that. His OSF was that he had a weak password, his cat name + some numbers, his cat was called chewy and the random numbers are 123, making the password be chewy123.<br><br>In that we see that we should make our passwords very strong, and not related to us in anyway, also add some characters. How did FBI find him, well idk too, but if anyone knows, I would be happy to update this post.",
