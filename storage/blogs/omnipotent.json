    "blog": "Santos Coelho from Portugal found himself in a bind due to his reckless actions. As we speak he has around six charges looming over him right now. His disregard for operational security became glaringly evident when, prior to his arrest related to raidforums, he landed in hot water with law enforcement in 2018. During a trip to the USA, he foolishly carried his cybercrime-related devices, leading to a warrant to search on them, on how FBI suspected him, we actually don't know. Surprisingly after a while, Santos exacerbated his situation by reaching out to law enforcement using an email which was used to register domains like rf.ws and raid.lol which were to be backup if the main domain got taken down. Quite the oversight, isn't it?<br><br>By the way, a word of advice: If law enforcement confiscates your device, it's prudent to dispose of it, even if you consider yourself ethically sound. The risk simply isn't worth it.",
