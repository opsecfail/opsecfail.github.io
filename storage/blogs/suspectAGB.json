So after murdering some ops, dude flew to Kenya, (my country, dang, today am feelin' at home) to cool down. The hunger for clout got the bad of him, so the used to go online and yap yap yap, but one thing you should learn never share a photo if you do illegal thing, (by the way, Dream's(the minecraft youtuber) address got leaked coz of some doxxing try hard saw the interior of the house, which lead him to know Dream's address), so about suspect AGB he  did share a picture of him in a kitchen, guess the country he flew in was  the one who snitched on him, first of all where he was living looked the Kenyan medium class style which is common, so ma fellow Kenyan had his tail winkle that he must be in Kenya, just coz the plugs in the kitchen are the most common in Kenya, the kitchen always have tile on the wall, and it's texture is the same, and of course his posts metadata..... and to finish this, somebody did say the air moisture looks Kenya, idk how to explain it to you but pretty I would know a picture from Kenya just on how the air looks based on the environment , nvm you wouldn't understand... By the way he did start posting him being outside, the worst you can do, plus KENYAN AND UK GLOWIES BE FRIENDS, so just know where you running to. And if you really wanna clout post it after like a decade, and make sure you planets away from the place you took the picture",
