    "blog": "After some questionable activities, our rapper decided to take a breather in a new country, Kenya. However, his thirst for attention led him to overshare online. Here's a crucial lesson: never share incriminating photos. Take, for instance, Dream (the Minecraft YouTuber)—his address got leaked due to a doxxing attempt aided by his house's interior. Similarly, our suspect, AGB, made a critical error by sharing a kitchen photo. Observant individuals quickly pinpointed his location, thanks to telltale signs like common household plugs and the typical kitchen setup. Moreover, the metadata of his posts gave him away.<br><br>To wrap it up, someone even noted the distinct air moisture in the photo, a unique feature. It's hard to explain, but it's a dead giveaway. Anyway, he eventually started posting photos from outside—the worst move possible. Remember, authorities often collaborate, so choose your hideout wisely.<br><br>If you're itching for clout, wait a decade before posting, and ensure you're lightyears away from the scene",
