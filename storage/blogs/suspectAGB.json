    "blog": "After some questionable activities, our rapper decided to take a breather in a new country, Kenya. However, his thirst for attention led him to overshare online. Here's a crucial lesson: never share incriminating photos. Take, for instance, Dream (the Minecraft YouTuber)—his address got leaked due to a doxxing attempt aided by his house's interior. Similarly, our suspect, AGB, made a critical error by sharing a kitchen photo. Observant individuals quickly pinpointed his location, thanks to telltale signs like common household plugs and the typical kitchen setup.
