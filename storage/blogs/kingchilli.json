Cumba went form bad guy to good guy to bad guy, imagine being caught because of cybercrime, then the glowies make with you  convenant, you get to even work with the feds as a full time job , the you go right back to your cybercri life, sadly life is not God, you might not get a second chance, now he is serving a 20 year sentence, set to be free in 2028.<br<br> Despite operating under various aliases and online personas, Gonzalez failed to adequately conceal his identity. He frequently communicated with other hackers using his real name and shared personal details that could be traced back to him. This lack of anonymity made it relatively easy for law enforcement agencies to connect the dots and identify him as the mastermind behind the cybercrimes.<br><br>Effective OpSec relies heavily on secure communication channels and encryption methods to prevent eavesdropping and interception. However, Gonzalez and his accomplices often communicated via unencrypted channels, including internet chat rooms and instant messaging platforms. These communications left a digital trail that investigators later used to build their case against him.<br><br>This is what lead to his second arrest, is that he lived a lavish lifestyle that raised suspicion among law enforcement agencies. He flaunted his ill-gotten wealth, purchasing expensive cars, luxury goods, and even hosting extravagant parties. Such conspicuous consumption drew attention to him and ultimately contributed to his arrest. Find some way to show legit source of money. Peace out.",
