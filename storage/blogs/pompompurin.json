    "blog": "Pom, a cybercri caught by FBI, his OSF is  yappin' and mentioning his  irl alias through his cybercri alias. STORY TIME: Long time ago before time had its name, ai.type db got leaked on raidforums, so Pom noticed that the leaks doesn't seem to include every user and one was himself, so he goes ahead an DMs Omnipotent asking to verify if his old email is there. First of all sharing ur irl email  is bad, to add salt to the injury it had both of his names in it, conorfitzpatrick02@gmail.com. So when time got it's name, FBI raided raidforoums, raid got raided lol, and ofc they checked Pom messages and they found him sharing his email, the also found it was linked to a google pay account which revealed his second email conorfitzpatrick2002@gmail.com and they use the same IP address in which Pom also used to join on raidforums. What do we learn?: First, of all keep ur irl alias far far far far away from ur cybercri alias. Second, use a proxy, vpn or anything that won't lead back to you. Third, don't yap much.",
