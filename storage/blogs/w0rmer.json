"blog": " In 2012, w0rmer was a known well hacker, he used to break into several government systems, but his well know hack is when he broke into the New York police department.<br><br>Why is this hack his main one, this is because the prior to this, the New York police departed violently cracked down on Occupy Wall Street protesters. Most of the police officers used dreadful tactics that some had to cover their badges. But w0rmer released identity of some of the cop.<br><br>His OSF was kinda unbelievably dumb, but maybe at that time it was not well known, the photo you see on this post is the one that led to his OSF, w0rmer took a picture of his girlfriend displaying that message, which had exif data on it, so the feds visited his girlfriend who without hesitation said his bf asked him to take the picture.<br><br>Soon enough the fed were able to figure out his true identity, he was a 30 year old software engineer living in Texas by the name Figenio Akoa. They also got hold of his social media accounts including facebook messages his @ananwama twitter handle... w0rmer did admit being guilty.<br><br>So be sure to clear all exif data of photo you post online, or anything you post online.",
