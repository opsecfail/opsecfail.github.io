His nickname, \"homeless hacker\", came from him not have a permanent address had a nomadic lifestyle and he did hate that name. More about him in the links below, we gonna go directly to his  OSF. Unlike many hackers, he hacked out off curiosity and not for financial gain.<br><br>Lamo's OSF was basically arrogance and carelessness despite his technical skip for infiltrating high-profile targets. He had a habit of leaving logs of his hacking activities on compromised systems. Some of them were intentional an example is when he hacked into New York Times, He addead an entry: Adrain Lamo to the Times db, his cell number as 415 505-HACK and declared his areas of exepretise as computer hacking, national security, communications intelligence. He also boasty a lot online.<br><br>We might say Adrian tried to do bugbounty without permission, some companies were happy others weren't, he did receive a lot of heat on the hacker space when he snitched on Manning, this basically followed him his whole life, but I think all Manning wanted is attention. You can check more of his story on the links below. By the way he did commit suicide, peace out.",
